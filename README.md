```
mern-ecommerce-store/
|-- client/
|   |-- public/
|   |-- src/
|   |   |-- components/
|   |   |-- context/

|   |   |-- App.js
|   |   |-- index.js
|   |   |-- ...
|   |-- package.json
|-- server/
|   |-- config/
|   |-- controllers/
|   |-- middleware/
|   |-- models/
|   |-- routes/
|   |-- app.js
|   |-- server.js
|   |-- ...
|-- package.json
|-- README.md
```

## Configuration

1. **Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory with the following environment variables:

   ```env
   PORT=3001
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost/ecommerce
   JWT_SECRET=yoursecretkey
   ```

   Adjust the values according to your needs.

   ```env
   STRIPE_API_KEY=yourstripeapikey
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the server (from the `server` directory):

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. Start the client (from the `client` directory):
